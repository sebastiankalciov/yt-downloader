A simple to use **YouTube** video downloader.
## Technology used
This tool is made using **Python(Flask)** for Back-End, **HTML** and **Tailwindcss** for Front-End.

## Requirements:
You need to install:
* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) (I strongly recommend, if you're a beginner in programming, to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) because it's easier to install and it comes with all the stuff you need to run Python apps.)
* Pip Module [pytube](https://pypi.org/project/pytube/)
* Pip Module [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)


## Usage
Open a command prompt and run the command from below. Make sure you are in the required directory(yt-downloader/app/templates).
```bash
$ set FLASK_APP = run.py
$ flask run
# Make sure you are in the right directory, otherwise you will get an error.
```

## Up coming updates
Reminder: This project is still in beta, bugs may appear, it's not completely done. 
* A modern design.
* More functionality.
* Reducing the size of the code.
Hopefully, to be done by the end of this year.
