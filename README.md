A simple to use **YouTube** Video Downloader.


## Technology used
This tool is made using **Django** and Html/Css(TailWindCss).

## Requirements:
You need to install:
* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) (I strongly recommend, if you're a beginner in programming, to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) because it's easier to install and it comes with all the stuff you need to run Python apps.)
* Pip Module [pytube](https://pypi.org/project/pytube/) (latest version)
* Web-Framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/)
* In app/src/static/ it should be installed tailwind.css file from official website.
## Usage
Open a command prompt and run the command from below. Make sure you are in the required directory(yt-downloader/app).
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
# Open a browser and get to 127.0.0.1:8000 (Default address where Django starts the web app)
# Make sure you are in the right directory, otherwise you will get an error.
```

## Updates
* Earlier version of this tool was made using **Flask**, now it's made using **Django**
* New design
